# tic-tac-toe
A classic Tic Tac Toe game is recreated using HTML, CSS and JavaScript in this project. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where two players alternate marking spaces with either an X or an O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
